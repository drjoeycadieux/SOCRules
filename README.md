# Yara Rules

This repository contains Yara rules for detecting various types of malicious files.

## What is Yara?

Yara is a powerful open-source tool for identifying malware and other unwanted content. It uses text patterns and other characteristics to match files against predefined rules.

## How to Use These Rules

1. **Install Yara:**
    * **Linux/macOS:**
        Yara is often pre-installed or available through package managers (e.g., `apt-get install yara` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install yara` on macOS).
    * **Windows:**
        Download the pre-compiled binaries from the official Yara website (https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/download.html) and add the path to your system's environment variables.

2. **Save the Rules:**
    * Clone this repository to your local machine.
    * The Yara rules are located in the `.yara` files within the repository.

3. **Scan Files or Directories:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Yara rule file (e.g., `my_rules.yara`).
    * Use the following command to scan a file or directory:

    ```bash
    yara my_rules.yara <file_or_directory_to_scan>
    ```

    * **Example:**

    ```bash
    yara my_rules.yara suspicious_file.exe
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yara my_rules.yara /path/to/directory
    ```

4. **Analyze the Output:**
    * Yara will display the results of the scan.
    * If a file matches a rule, it will indicate the rule name and the matching strings.
